        <h2>Exploring the Board</h2>
        Below you can see a typical accordion bass board.
        Moving around the board will show the corresponding row and column.
        Each row is a different type of chord/note.
        Each column is different note, with adjacent columns being a 5th apart.
        (You can also select <b>Board Vertical</b> and turn off the highliting in the Options menu.)

        <h4>Sound</h4>
        Clicking a button will play a synthesized MIDI sound for that note or chord.
        Sound can be configured, or turned off in the <b>Sound</b> Menu.
        The <b>Arpeggiate Chord</b> option will play the notes of a chord in sequence
        rather than all at once.
        A different MIDI instrument can be selected for the Bass buttons and the Chord buttons.
        <br/>(If there is no sound but sound is set to on, please let me know.)
      </div>
      <div class="tabContent" id="ChordMatch">
        <h2>Button Combining</h2>
        Combining multiple bass and chord, a more advanced technqiue, allows
        for almost any chord to be played.<br/>
        Below, you can <b>Click</b> and <b>Shift+Click</b> to select several buttons
        at the same time (up to 4).
        You will see a list possible chords (often more than one) that correspond to
        those buttons.
        <h4>Redundant Buttons</h4>
        On the accordion, when certain buttons are pressed, buttons that have the same
        notes are automatically pressed, that is, they will fall through.
        This is the intended effect of the Stradella system, buttons that are connected
        to the same notes have no effect. <br/>To see which buttons are made redundant,
        the notes by them are already pressed, select <b>Press Redundant Buttons</b>
        item in the Options.
      </div>
      <div class="tabContent" id="ChordPicker">
        <h2>Chord Picker</h2>
        Below you can select any chord and see the different ways that it can be played
        on the accordion bass side.
        You can choose from an existing list of chords, and also edit the chord by
        manipulating the steps within that chord. Changing the root will move the chord to that note.
        <h3>Chord Inversion</h3>
        Optionally, you can add an inversion to a chord.
        Specifying an inversion will imply that the root note is played in the bass and that
        it is the lowest note played. All other inversions of the chord will be filtered out.
        <h3>Possible Button Combos Table</h3>
        The table on the right lists the button possibilities for the currently selected chord.
        The lowest note is specified in parantheses.<br/>
        Mid C = the lowest C played by a chord button.<br/>
        Bass C = the lowest C played by a bass button, lower than the Mid C.
        If an inversion is set, only button combos with the correct root in the bass will be displayed.

      </div>
      <div class="tabContent" id="SeqPicker">
        <h2>Common Progressions & Scales</h2>
        Below you can see some common progressions that are played on the accordion bass.
        <h3>Progressions</h3>
        Provided are two of the simplest rhythms, the Oom-Pah (Polka) and the Waltz.
        (More Rhythms to be added soon!)
        The basic pattern alternates between the root and the chord note.
        Some common enchacements, such as alternating between the 5th and sometimes the 3rd
        of the chord being played, are also available.
        One a progression is set, click the <b>Play</b> to simulate the pattern.
        <h3>Scales</h3>
        A few common scales have been added as well. The scales only use bass notes
        and are the basis of playing melody and bass runs on the accordion bass.
        (More to be added!)
        <h3>Multiple Seqs</h3>
        By selecting the Multiple Seqs button, you can build a list of progressions
        and string them together. Any Progression or Scale can be combined together
        to form a long progression.
      </div>
      <div class="tabContent" id="CustomSeq">
        <h2>Custom Progression</h2>
        Here you can enter a completely custom sequence of chords and notes, seperated by a comma.
        ex. <b>A, B, C,  Am, E7</b>
        <h4>Chord Abbreviations</h4>
        All Chord abbreviations available in the chord picker can be entered.
        (Refer to the list of chords in the Chord Picker for full list)
        (Note: Add List here?)
        <h4>Listing Notes In A Chord</h4>
        You can also list notes in a chord entirely by placing it in brackets.
        Ex. <b>[A C E], E</b> is the same as writing <b>Am, E</b>
        Any combinations of notes can be included in the brackets.
        Ex. <b>[A B C D E]</b>
        <h4>Recent Progression History</h4>
        All entered progressions are saved (until <b>Clear Recent</b> is clicked)
        If you've made a mistake, or want to go back to a previous progression,
        click <b>Show Recent</b> or the drop down on the right to see and
        select from a list of recent progressions.
      </div>
      <div class="tabContent" id="Default">
        <h2>Accordion Bass Analyzer</h2>
        Below you can see the whole analyzer put together.
        Each of the different modes are available as separate tabs in the analyzer.
        There is also an additional <b>Options</b> tab for advanced searched settings.

        <h4>Search Options</h4>
        In the <b>Options</b> tab, you can alter the search settings used to filter out
        possible button combos.
        For example, <b>Max Button Combo Size</b> can be adjusted to only
        allow combinations with up to 2 buttons, a more reasonable limit.

        <h4>Finger Search (alpha)</h4>
        There is also an option to include fingering on all the button combinations.
        It can be enabled through either the <b>Options</b> tab or menu.
        Finger searching is not quite working correctly for all combinations,
        but the eventual goal is to have the finger search be a pivotal aspect of the
        analyzer.

        <h5>The Accordion Bass Analyzer is a complex application.
          Any and all feedback is welcomed. Please let me know any thoughts on this project
          and if you have requests and especially ideas on further usage.
